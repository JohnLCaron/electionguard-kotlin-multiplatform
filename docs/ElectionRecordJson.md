* The encrypted_ballots directory contain all ballots, cast or challenged.
* The challenged_ballots directory contain only challenged ballots.
* DecryptedTallyJson and DecryptedBallotJson use the same schema (DecryptedTallyOrBallotJson)

## Private files
encrypt

These files are not part of the election record, but are generated for internal use.
In production, these must be stored in a secure place.

### KeyCeremony

Each trustee maintains their own private copy of their crypto data. They must keep this data secret, to ensure the
security of the election.

````
private_data/trustees/
    decryptingTrustee-{trusteeName}.json
````    

### Encryption

During the encryption stage, input plaintext ballots are checked for consistency against the manifest. 
The ones that fail are not encrypted, and are placed in a private directory for examination by election officials.

````
private_data/input/
       pballot-<ballotId>.json
       pballot-<ballotId>.json
       ...
